//  * date

//  * zip 

// as the input parameter, return the 

//  * temperature for the date for that zip.


// we are only allow to use this openwathermap api to query today's weather


// that means, if we didn't retrieve the weather yesterday, we cannot return it, simply return something to the caller.
